# Sunrise and Sunset Calculator

BASIC program for the ZX80 or Minstrel 2 (with 8K ROM) to calculate the sunrise and sunset times at a given location (latitude and longitude), time zone, and date in the year.

The program requires at least 4K of RAM to run.

The program is adapted from a BBC Micro listing on the Internet. Sadly, I do not have the details of the original author. If you have any information, please let me know.
