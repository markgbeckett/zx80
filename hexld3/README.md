# HEXLD3 (for ZX80 with 4K ROM)

HEXLD3 is a tool, created by Toni Baker, in her book "Mastering Machine Code on Your ZX81 (and ZX80)", to help people learn and write machine code.

Readers of the book would progressing develop the tool as they read the book (mostly, in Chapter 9) and use it to write some interesting and creative examples of machine code on the ZX81 and ZX80.

There are two different versions of the tool: the ZX81 version (which is also suitable for a ZX80 with the updated 8K ROM) is the focus. Those wishing to type in the 4K ROM version need to make adjustments to the code as listed and, when I tried to do this, I found some problems.

In 2011, Thunor published a 4K ROM version, including some of the changes that they needed to make to get it to work and this was incredibly useful and I have built on this. Thunor's 4K ROM version mostly works though I found some minor issues, which I have attempted to fix.

Moving forward, I plan to make some further improvements and extensions to HEXLD3, as follows:

- [ ] Add a jump block at start of m/code, to make it easier to modify without breaking BASIC wrapper.
- [ ] Document how to relocate the m/code, to adapt to different use cases.
- [ ] Add the improved code-listing capability, which is described by Toni Baker as "level 2" disassembly.
- [ ] Add features from, later, ZX Spectrum version of HEXLD3 -- including support for adding text and for creating a breakpoint.
- [ ] Port the full disassembler from the ZX Spectrum version of the book.
