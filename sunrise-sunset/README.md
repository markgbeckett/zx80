# Sunrise and Sunset Calculator

BASIC program for the ZX80 (with 8K ROM) to calculate the sunrise and sunset times at a given location (latitude and longitude), time zone, and date in the year.

The program is adapted from a BBC Micro listing on thie Internet. Sadly, the details of the original author are lost to me. If you have any information, please let me know.
