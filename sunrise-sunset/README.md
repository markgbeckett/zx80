# Sunrise and Sunset Calculator

BASIC program for the ZX80 or Minstrel 2 (with 8K ROM) to calculate the sunrise and sunset times at a given location (latitude and longitude), time zone, and date in the year.

The program requires at least 4K of RAM to run.

The program is adapted from a BBC Micro listing created by R.G. Stuart of Mexico City, Mexico, and published in Sky and Telescope magazine (Sinnott, Roger W. "Sunrise Sunset Challenge: The Winners." Sky and telescope 89.3 (1995): 84-. Print).
